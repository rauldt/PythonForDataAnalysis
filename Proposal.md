**Title**: House prices econometric analysis  

**Goals**: Using publicly available data on houses sold in 1999, I seek to model the relationship between house features and price.  

**Methods**: OLS linear regresion.  

**Packages**:  
  * Numpy,  
  * Pandas, and   
  * Matplotlib  
These packages will allow me to conduct descriptive statistics of covariates and later to conduct residual analysis.
